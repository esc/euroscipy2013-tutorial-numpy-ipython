:Bio:            Valentin Haenel is an software developer with experience
                 working in a scientific context. He is the co-author of a
                 scientific toolbox used in experimental psychology research
                 and has worked on a large-scale brain simulation project in
                 the past.

                 He has been teaching at the `Advanced Scientific Programming
                 in Python Summerschool materials
                 <https://python.g-node.org/wiki/>`_ where his main focus is
                 the lecture on best practices and contributing to the schools
                 programming framework `Pelita
                 <http://aspp.github.com/pelita/>`_. He has been tutorial chair
                 for the `EuroScipy conference <https://www.euroscipy.org/>`_
                 in 2011 and 2012 and is one of the editors of the `Python
                 Scientific Lecture Notes
                 <http://scipy-lectures.github.com/>`_. Recently, he taught a
                 `week-long course for PhD students and Postdocs at the EPFL in
                 Switzerland <https://github.com/pcp13>`_ and authored an
                 article about `interfacing Python and C
                 <http://scipy-lectures.github.com/advanced/interfacing_with_c/interfacing_with_c.html>`_.

:Description:    This tutorial is a hands-on introduction to the two most basic
                 building-blocks of the scientific Python stack: the enhanced
                 interactive interpreter IPython and the fast numerical
                 container Numpy. Amongst other things you will learn how to
                 structure an interactive workflow for scientific computing and
                 how to create and manipulate numerical data efficiently. You
                 should have some basic familiarity with Python (variables,
                 loops, functions) and basic command-line usage (executing
                 commands, using history).
:Outline:        **Ipython** (1 hour)

                 * Using the IPython notebook
                 * Help system, magic functions, aliases and history

                 **Numpy** (3 hours)

                 * Basic arrays, dtypes and numerical operations
                 * Indexing, slicing, reshaping and broadcasting
                 * Copies, views and fancy indexing

                 The tutorial will feature short bursts of small exercises every
                 5-10 minutes.

:Package List:   An install of `Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/>`_ should
                 be enough

                 * Numpy (Version 1.6 or higher)
                 * Ipython (Version 0.13 or higher)
                 * Matplotlib (Version 1.2.1 or higher)

:Documentation:  I have converted a large part of the `Numpy chaper
                 <http://scipy-lectures.github.io/intro/numpy/index.html>`_
                 from the `Python Scientific Lecture Notes
                 <http://scipy-lectures.github.com/>`_ to IPython notebook
                 format using the ``sphinx2ipynb`` converter from the
                 `nbconvert project <https://github.com/ipython/nbconvert>`_.
                 All materials are collected in my
